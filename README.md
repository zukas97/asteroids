# Asteroids


A simple asteroid shooting game made in C with SDL.

The binairy I released is compiled on linux so I don't know if it will work on windows.

# Building 

Dependancies:
`make`<br /> 
`SDL2` dev files <br />
`SDL2_image` dev files <br />

I didn't say a spicific package name bc it is different for each distro
  
to build run `make`

you can also run `make run` to compile it, run it, and then remove it.

# Binairy
I have not yet made a package for any distro as this is still in development but there is a binairy in releases

<u>Dependancies:</u> <br />

`SDL2`

`SDL2_image`
