# Asteroids


A simple asteroid shooting game made in C with SDL.

__THIS IS NOT FINISHED YET IT IS OPEN TO CONTRIBUTERS__

# Building 

Dependancies:
`make`<br /> 
`SDL2` dev files <br />
`SDL2_image` dev files <br />

I didn't say a spicific package name bc it is different for each distro
  
to build run `make`
