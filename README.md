# Asteroids


A simple asteroid shooting game made in C with SDL.

this is still a WIP but can now can be considered a "game" (sort-of)

# Building 

Dependancies:
`make`<br /> 
`SDL2` dev files <br />
`SDL2_image` dev files <br />

I didn't say a spicific package name bc it is different for each distro
  
to build run `make`

you can also run `make run` to compile it, run it, and then remove it.
